# Investor Outreach Email Templates

## Template 1: Cold Outreach (Warm Intro Preferred)

**Subject:** DeFiSwap – Privacy-first swap aggregator on Arbitrum ($1M pre-seed)

Hi [Investor Name],

I'm [Your Name], founder of **DeFiSwap** – a cross-chain swap aggregator with MEV protection and custom liquidity pools, live on Arbitrum.

**Problem:** DeFi traders lose millions to MEV front-running and waste time comparing bridge routes. Existing aggregators (1inch, Matcha) don't prioritize privacy; privacy tools (CoW Swap) don't aggregate cross-chain.

**Solution:** DeFiSwap combines best-price routing (0x + CoW) with optional privacy mode (Flashbots) and smart bridging (CCTP/CCIP/Socket) in one UX. Plus: custom AMM pools for token campaigns.

**Traction:** Live on Arbitrum mainnet at decaflow.vercel.app. Phase 1-3 shipped (swap, bridge, wallet). Preparing pool contracts for audit and first 2-3 token campaign partnerships.

**Ask:** Raising $1M pre-seed ($8-10M cap) for team, audits, and GTM. 12-15 month runway to $50M volume and Series A.

Would love to share a demo and deck. Are you open to a 20-min call this week or next?

## Template 2: Follow-Up (After No Response)

**Subject:** Re: DeFiSwap – Quick demo?

Hi [Investor Name],

Following up on my note about **DeFiSwap** – the privacy-first swap aggregator on Arbitrum.

Since I last reached out:
- Deployed mainnet aggregator with 0x + CoW routing
- Added analytics tracking (volume, users, top pairs)
- Completed legal compliance (ToS, geo-blocking)
- Preparing smart contract audits for pool launch

Happy to send a 2-min Loom walkthrough if that's easier than a call. Let me know!

Best,  
[Your Name]

## Template 3: Warm Intro Request

**Subject:** Intro request to [Investor Name] at [Fund]

Hi [Mutual Connection],

Hope you're doing well! Quick favor:

I'm raising a $1M pre-seed for **DeFiSwap**, a cross-chain swap aggregator with MEV protection on Arbitrum (live at decaflow.vercel.app). We're focused on privacy-first trading and custom pools for token campaigns.

I saw [Investor Name] at [Fund] invested in [Similar Portfolio Company] – seems like a great fit. Would you be open to making an intro if you think it makes sense?

Happy to send a deck or one-pager for context. Really appreciate it!

Best,  
[Your Name]

**Subject:** DeFiSwap pre-seed – closing soon

Hi [Investor Name],

Quick update on **DeFiSwap**'s $1M pre-seed:

We're nearly oversubscribed with commitments from [Name 1-2 investors if possible, or "strategic angels in DeFi"]. Planning to close by [Date] and kick off audits + first token campaigns.

Wanted to loop back in case you're still interested – happy to carve out a small allocation if helpful.

## Template 6: Partner/Token Community Outreach

**Subject:** Partner opportunity – Custom liquidity pools on DeFiSwap

Hi [Token Project Name] team,

I'm [Your Name], founder of **DeFiSwap** – a cross-chain swap aggregator on Arbitrum (decaflow.vercel.app).

We're launching **custom liquidity pools** designed for token campaigns:

**Why partner with us:**
